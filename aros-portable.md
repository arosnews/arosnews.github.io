title: AROS Portable
---

We’re excited to announce the release of a new portable AROS distribution, designed to run directly from a USB stick. This project was created for users who want to explore AROS without the need to install it on a hard drive or invest in dedicated hardware.

Watch the system in action:

Who is this for?

This distribution is aimed at:

- curious users who want to try out AROS without prior experience,
- those who don’t own (or don’t want to buy) compatible recommended hardware,
- enthusiasts who want to carry AROS in their pocket – ready to boot on the go.

This is not meant to replace existing AROS distributions, but rather to complement them. It’s a convenient tool for discovering and using AROS in a modern and accessible way.

System requirements:

- A reasonably modern x86_64 (64-bit) computer,
- USB 3.0 support (both host and USB stick),
- A 1920×1080 display.

What does it offer?

- Quick and easy boot from USB – no installation required,
- A ready-to-use graphical environment upon launch,
- User experience similar to that of dedicated hardware.
