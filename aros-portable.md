Who is this for?

This distribution is aimed at:

- curious users who want to try out AROS without prior experience,
- those who don’t own (or don’t want to buy) compatible recommended hardware,
- enthusiasts who want to carry AROS in their pocket – ready to boot on the go.

This is not meant to replace existing AROS distributions, but rather to complement them. It’s a convenient tool for discovering and using AROS in a modern and accessible way.

System requirements:

- A reasonably modern x86_64 (64-bit) computer,
- USB 3.0 support (both host and USB stick),
- A 1920×1080 display,
- Processor virtualization option (usually Intel VT-x, “Intel Virtualization Technology” or AMD-V, “SVM Mode”) available in BIOS/UEFI and enabled.

What does it offer?

- Quick and easy boot from USB – no installation required,
- A ready-to-use graphical environment upon launch,
- User experience similar to that of dedicated hardware.
