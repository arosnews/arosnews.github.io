New versions of the Odyssey Web Browser were extensively tested in September. On the AROS World forum, Deadwood regularly makes the latest builds available for anyone to download and test. It's worth doing, because the main target, YouTube support, is already working quite well! We're looking forward to the full version of OWB 2.0.

AMIGASYSTEM has released an update to its AROS One distribution. Version 2.6 includes all the latest system fixes. The full list of changes is posted [here](https://arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1124&pid=6231#post_6231). AROS One is the best option for beginning AROS users or returning users. The distribution is based on the current ABIv0 release, is filled with useful software, is properly configured and offers great customization options.

On the YouTube channel InstallOS appeared [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7YjufrJqDs) of the installation of AROS One 2.6. An overview of the content of the new version of the distribution can also be found on James Mattson's channel - [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml3XaQaqcQw), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx1kLvR9fs4). I especially recommend the Proteque-CBN channel, where the author has posted [a video of AROS One 2.6 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNXauy5m5Wc) with his own commentary.

AirSoft Softwair has released a new version of its Hollywood plug-in for playing sound files in SID format. Version 2.0 completely changes the main engine supporting this format, replacing TinySID with the new cRSID. This makes emulation more precise and supports Real SID. The version for AROS x86 can be downloaded [from here](https://www.hollywood-mal.com/download/SID_Amiga.lha).
