The event of March is Deadwood's release of a new 32-bit base version of the system (AROS ABIv0 20250313). This update brings the 32-bit kernel to the same level as the upcoming 64-bit release, which is constantly being worked on. In addition, the 68k version also receives patches. There is still a lot going on in the AROS world, and those interested in using the Amiga system in this release cannot complain of boredom!

A new version of the 32-bit AROS base system (ABIv0 20250313) is now available for download. This version includes all of the changes from the last three years of system development, as well as a number of improvements. Major changes include:

- Improved support for newer hardware, including ACPI support.
- Improved stability and support for disk and network drivers.
- More than 60 bug fixes for programs and system libraries.
- Stabilization of drivers for virtualization (VirtualBox, VMware and QEMU), allowing the system to be tested in virtual environments before purchasing the appropriate hardware.
- Updates to core system libraries.

The packages are available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/deadwood2/AROS/releases/tag/ABIv0_20250313-1). An [update](https://github.com/deadwood2/AROS/releases/download/ABIv0_20220318-1/AROS-20220318-1-U3-any-i386-update.zip) has also been made available for those who already have a previous version of AROS installed (20220318-1). In addition, there is a [list of recommended hardware](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Platforms/x86_Complete_System_HCL#Recommended_hardware_(32-bit)) on WikiBooks that can help you choose the right one.

Carlo Spadoni (AMIGASYSTEM) announced that based on the new system, the next release of the 32-bit AROS One distribution will soon be available. At the same time, work is underway on its first 64-bit version. In addition, AROS One 68k for Motorola processors is expected to receive an update to version 2.0 - a test version is already available.  

Meanwhile, Olaf Schönweiß is on the final straight in working on the **AROS Vision** distribution for the 68k architecture, and its official release should be imminent.

The address of the AROS Archives website has changed. The domain archives.aros-exec.org, which for years directed to the AROS repository, has expired. The new address is: [https://archives.arosworld.org](https://archives.arosworld.org).

In March, the AROS Archives was largely dominated by game ports intended for future 64-bit distributions. Most of them were already available on the 32-bit version of the system, but in some cases new ports were released for newer versions.
