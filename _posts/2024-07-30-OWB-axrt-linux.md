To install Odyssey Web Browser under Linux, we will use the latest distribution **Linux Mint 22 “Willma” (Cinnamon Edition)**. Make sure in **Update Manager** that your system is fully up to date.

Using a Linux browser, download the latest archives with the [**LibAxRT**](https://axrt.org/download/axrt/4.0/packages/libaxrt-4.0_41.12-1_amd64.deb) package, the [**OWB-Libs**](https://axrt.org/download/axrt/4.0/other/OWB-Libs-for-x86_64-axrt.zip) libraries, the [**OWB**](https://archives.arosworld.org/share/network/browser/owb-2.1.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) browser and the launcher for OWB [**StartOWB**](https://axrt.org/download/axrt/4.0/other/StartOWB) from [https://axrt.org/download/axrt/4.0/](https://axrt.org/download/axrt/4.0/).

Install the **LibAxRT** package first.

Go into the properties of the **StartOWB** file and under the *Permissions* tab, check the box *Allow executing file as program*. Then run the **StartOWB** file.

After running **StartOWB**, *SYS* and *Work* directories will be created in the home directory. 

{: .box-note}
Running any AxRT application will create *SYS* and *Work* directories in the home directory.

- Extract the archive with **OWB-Libs** to */home/username/SYS*. 
- Extract the archive with **OWB** to */home/username/Work*.
- Move the **StartOWB** file to the directory with Oddysey Web Browser (*/home/username/Work/owb-x86_64*).

In the owb-x86_64 directory, rename the file “OWB.info.axrt” to “OWB.info”. This will give you an icon with a tooltype that launches OWB using CONCURRENT_JIT.

You can now start Odyssey Web Browser by clicking on **StartOWB**. Note that the first startup of OWB takes longer than usual, as fonts are initialized during this time.

{: .box-success}
There is a clipboard between the AxRT applications and the hosting system. You can use the clipboard with CTRL+C, CTRL+V on the host side and AMIGA+C, AMIGA+V on the AxRT side.

Feel free to visit the [AROS World](https://www.arosworld.org) forum, where you can ask additional questions about using AROS, AxRT and OWB. You can also report there any performance bugs you encounter.
