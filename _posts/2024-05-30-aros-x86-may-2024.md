In May, the AROS community, as usual, was not idle. At the beginning of the month, Deadwood released a cumulative set of patches for the base system at 20220318-1. The **Update 1** mainly contains the "irritating bugs of the month" fixes introduced over the past few months.

In the coming days we can expect a distribution of AROS One 2.5, which will include all the current patches plus many additional improvements. At this moment, a slimmed-down version of the system - [AROS One 2.5 Lite](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kf8UvgrhaAffY3WABssQLbfPIa9T28Up/view?usp=sharing) - is available for download. This version contains the latest core and all patches, but in response to the expectations of some users, Development and some of the software from Extras have been removed. In anticipation of the full distribution, you can read [an interview with Carlo “AMIGASYSTEM” Spadoni](https://obligement-free-fr.translate.goog/articles/itwcarlospadoni.php?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_sch=http) (author of the AROS One distribution) conducted by the OBLIGEMENT portal.

**Amiwell79** has launched a new site at [www.tinyaros.it](https://www.tinyaros.it). It features the Tiny AROS distribution version 3.2, as well as additional game and software packages.

In the poll for the Irritating Bug of the Month, we had a tie in May. An equal number of votes were received by the submissions:  
*#125 (You can access a drawer icon even if the directory assigned to it does not exist)*.  
*#140 (Wanderer: Changing the disk label does not work)*.

*Irritating bug of the month - May 2024*

By a random draw, Deadwood addressed the bug with icons, and the corresponding fix can already be downloaded in [May survey thread](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1246&pid=5344). Bug #140 automatically rolls over to June and therefore there will be no new poll next month.

The strong items in the AROS Archives this time are certainly the **wipeOut** game port and the new version of the **LoView** image viewer. There are also a number of smaller offerings that may also catch your attention, including a whole series of games and programs from Giovanni Iacobelli. Below is the full list.

> ## [wipEout Rewrite](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=game/driving/wipeout_rewrite.i386-aros.zip) (v.1.2)
> (Authors: phoboslab/arczi/Farox)

wipEout Rewrite is a reimplementation of the 1995 cult game, in which players race on futuristic tracks using high-speed anti-gravity ships. The version from the AROS Archives does not include the game's assets (textures, 3D models, etc.); they can be downloaded from [the original port author's site](https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout). For fans of the game wipEout, this is a great opportunity to return to nostalgia and feel the spirit of futuristic racing!
