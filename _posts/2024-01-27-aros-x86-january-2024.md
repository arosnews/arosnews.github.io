title: AROS x86 - January 2024
subtitle: monthly roundup

---

January was marked by the implementation of a **new C library** in AROS x86. This change is intended to make life easier primarily for AROS developers themselves. The 32-bit version will be more compatible with the 64-bit version, so maintaining two development lines will become easier. In the long run, it is also a step bringing AROS closer to a complete transition to the 64-bit version.

Currently, software compatibility testing is still going on, and some things need to be recompiled. All this means that we can expect a new stable build no sooner than the end of February. In addition, there is a good chance that along with it we will get a slightly refreshed version of the OWB web browser.

I posted a tutorial on the blog about [preparing a USB stick with ABIv0](https://arosnews.github.io/how-to-prepare-usb-flash-drive-aros/). It's done a little differently from other systems, so I believe this tutorial will be useful for beginners.

In the January poll for "Irritating bug of the month", the problem with saving boot parameter settings was chosen.

The bug has already been fixed, in the latest build you can configure startup parameters in preferences. If you want to have a say in the order in which the bugs are fixed, I encourage you to register on the forums and take part in the [next vote](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1191&pid=3842).

There isn't much in the way of January news in the AROS Archives, but there is one program that is definitely worth a look. **RNOEffects**, written in Hollywood and available for all Amiga NGs, is developing rapidly and can certainly be useful in everyday use. Full list of new programs below.

A small tool for converting images to PDF. It is primarily used to convert scans taken with, for example, Scandal or Scanquix to PDF documents in specific output formats such as A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter or ImageSize, but can also be used to convert other image files.

- added function "Image2Image" to change the format of images
- added function "scan file(s)" to determine the attributes of the image(s)
- added function "rem (dup)" to remove duplicate entries from the listview
- added function "check" to check the given images if they are valid to process and to clean the listview from unvalid image files    
- added possibility to scale images to a fixed size
- added more formats for Image2PDF (B4, B5, US, Executive, Comm10)
- installer now sets the OS automatically (thanks Daniel ;-))
- key F1 now opens the guide file as help too
- updated tooltips
- optimized output messages
- fixed a bug where "read source" did not work correctly sometimes 
- many improvements done "under the hood" ... ;-)
