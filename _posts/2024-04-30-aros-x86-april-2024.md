title: AROS x86 - April 2024
subtitle: monthly roundup
lang: en
ref: 0424
---

In April 2024, although there was no new version of AROS for x86, there was still a lot going on. Deadwood continues to work on a prototype x86 emulator for the 64-bit version of the system. We can also expect a cumulative patch package from him for the latest build in the near future. The AROS community is extremely active, and this is bearing fruit in the form of numerous ports and software updates. Thanks to the involvement of new users who have ported or updated older applications, AROS has gained a lot of new capabilities. Let's take a closer look at what has appeared this month!

The site from which you could usually download the Tiny AROS distribution has disappeared from the web. However, we have nothing to worry about, as the author of the distribution - Amiwell79 - assures us that a new page, under a new address, will appear in the coming days. When that happens you will find the current link on this blog.

In the April poll for "irritating bug of the month" two were selected:  
*#116 (Wanderer: Allow deleting by pressing Del key)*  
*#105 (DiskInfo showing OFS instead of FAT)*  
Patches for these bugs have been prepared by **Deadwood** and can already be downloaded from the AROSWorld forum in the thread dedicated to the [April survey](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1228&pid=4744). They will also make their way into the next build as soon as it is released.

There are a lot of interesting items in AROS Archives, this time everyone will find something interesting for themselves. News in AROS Archives from April:

ScummVM - an interpreter that allows point-and-click games to run on modern systems. Initially designed to support LucasArts games using the SCUMM engine (the VM in the program's name stands for virtual machine), it now also supports products from other manufacturers such as Sierra Entertainment, Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. ScummVM is free software, released under the GPL. Thanks to **Deremon**, ScummVM for AROS has been updated to version 1.9.0.

ResidualVM is a cross-platform open-source 3D game interpreter for playing LucasArts' Lua/GrimE-based 3D adventure games Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, as well as Myst 3 and The Longest Journey. It has been ported to a wide variety of devices and operating systems. 

ResidualVM uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration of 3D graphics. A software renderer for machines without hardware OpenGL is also included. The latest available version of ResidualVM was compiled for AROS by **Deremon**.

> ## [ADoom3](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=game/fps/adoom3-1.5.3.i386-aros.zip) (v. 1.5.3)
> (author: Nick "Kalamatee" Andrews)

dhewm 3 is a source port of the Doom 3 GPL. It runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and AROS, but should run (or be easily portable to) any system that supports OpenGL 1.4 with ARB, SDL and OpenAL shaders. Compared to the original Doom3, dhewm3 has many bug fixes, supports EAX-like sound effects on all operating systems and hardware (via OpenAL Softs EFX), has much better support for widescreen resolutions and 64-bit support.

The Doom3 port for AROS is based on the dhewm3 branch from the latest version 1.5.3, and was compiled by **Deremon**.

To run, you need the original data files from the PC version. It can be purchased on GOG: https://www.gog.com/pl/game/doom_3

Magical Broom Extreme is a free horizontal shooter from Japanese developer Twin-Tail. It features 3D weapon effects and pretty binding gameplay.

> ## [Protrekkr 2](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=audio/tracker/protrekkr.i386-aros.zip) (v. 2.6.7)
> (author: Franck "hitchhikr" Charlet)

ProTrekkr is a tracker program that combines a software synthesizer along with a traditional sample tracker, which can (mostly) be used to create electronic music (e.g. psytrance, trance goa, hard acid, IDM, chip, techno, jungle, etc.) for small intros, demos or games. It is a heavily modified version of the old NoiseTrekker 2, which was created by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius aka Arguru.

Changes in the latest version:
- Fixed a crash when using the rand function on synth oscs & lfos under Linux
- Added playback procedure for PlayStation Vita
- Fixed a crash when loading older NoiseTrekker modules
- Startup screen is now optional

His sources can be found here https://github.com/M-HT/fulcrum.
