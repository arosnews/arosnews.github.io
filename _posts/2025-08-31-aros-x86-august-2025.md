August was full of new developments for AROS: Deadwood released the U1.B update packages and an updated SDK, while AMIGASYSTEM prepared an update for AROS One. The latest fixes also made their way into the AROS Portable project, and Kalamatee launched an updated version of Doom 3 under SDL2. Additionally, there were improvements to the ADT repository, an announcement of a RetroArch port, a new version of AROS Vision, and a refreshed AROSWorld forum.

**Deadwood** released the [**U1.B**](https://axrt.org/download/aros/v11/AROS-20250418-1-U1.B-any-x86_64-update.zip) update for the base system 20250418-1, as well as an [SDK update](https://axrt.org/download/aros/v11/SDK-20250418-1-U1-any-x86_64-update.zip). These packages include fixes from the past several months.

**AMIGASYSTEM** released an update package for the [AROS One](https://drive.google.com/file/d/175bS0GSN3YCQxJoXWkaQmczm20v3HKh1/view?usp=sharing) distribution, which includes the U1.B update and additionally enriches AROS One with new applications ([changelog](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1418&pid=9157)).

The [AROS Portable](https://arosnews.github.io/aros-portable/) project didn’t wait for its own update either—it's a great option for those who want to try out the latest system features, such as the **Odyssey Web Browser 3.0**, without needing to install anything. Just write the image to a USB stick and boot it on almost any modern computer.

Kalamatee continued working on the SDL2 port. The latest fixes he introduced allowed him to run the updated Doom 3 port:

Thanks to Deadwood's support and his contributions to OpenGL and SDL_Mixer, the first games compiled with SDL2 have already been uploaded to the AROS Archives.  

In addition, Kalamatee introduced fixes and improvements for AROS-Shell, SMP, font.datatype, iconlist, Zune, Wanderer, and many other system components to the ADT repository in August. It was a really busy month for him!  

Steffen **MagicSN** Häuser, on the other hand, announced the start of work on a **RetroArch** port for AROS – a powerful “combine” that integrates a number of emulators for various platforms: from classic arcade machines, through personal computers, to retro consoles. Compared to similar tools, RetroArch stands out with its user-friendly interface and ease of use. This project has the potential to significantly enrich AROS. It is worth supporting Steffen with a donation (PayPal: tirionareonwe@gmail.com).

**Olaf Schönweiß** has also released a new version of his distribution for the 68k architecture. [AROS Vision](https://www.aros-vision.de/) is available in both WinUAE and Apollo V4, and has also been included in [ApolloBoot](https://www.apollo-computer.com/apolloboot.php).

The AROSWorld forum has also received a refresh — thanks to the work of administrator **Amigamia**, the site now features a modern and more user-friendly design.

There’s no shortage of new content in the AROS Archives either — you’ll find several interesting additions, especially for demanding gamers:

> ## [Super-Haxagon](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=game/action/super-haxagon.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) (v. 3.9.1) `x86_64`
> (author: AJ Walter)

Super Hexagon is an intense and extremely challenging minimalist arcade game by Terry Cavanagh. The player controls a small triangle, dodging incoming obstacles to the rhythm of Chipzel's hypnotic electronic soundtrack. Its psychedelic, pulsating aesthetics and perfect synchronization of music with gameplay create an addictive yet unforgiving experience. Available on PC and mobile devices, the game is known for its overwhelmingly positive reviews, and its relentless difficulty and “just one more try” mechanics are the perfect test of reflexes and concentration. The AROS version is based on an open-source implementation of the game (Super-Haxagon) by AJ Walter.

> ## [TBFTSS: The Pandora War](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=game/action/tbftss.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) (v. 1.5.1) `x86_64`
> (author: Stephen J Sweeney)

The Battle for the Solar System: The Pandoran War is a 2D space shooter set in the science fiction universe known from the series of novels. The gameplay, taking place between the volumes of the book trilogy, allows you to pilot a variety of spaceships—including iconic units from the saga and completely new models—in over 60 non-linear missions. The player engages in intense battles, using tactical skills and cooperating with AI to face pirates, traitors, and the powerful army of Pandora. Thanks to its trophy system and rich storyline, the game is a treat for both lovers of classic shooters and fans of deep, literary science fiction.

> ## [Tilt-N-Roll](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=game/action/tiltnroll.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) (v. 1.2.0) `x86_64`
> (author: Greg Kennedy)

Tilt-n-Roll is a three-dimensional version of the classic ball game, created using OpenGL technology. You control the angle of the level using your mouse or keyboard. By rotating the world, you can guide the ball through various obstacles to the exit. The game has a built-in level editor that can be used to create and distribute levels among friends. A great choice for those looking for an unusual, light challenge with an interesting control concept.

Only Hollywood applications are still released for the 32-bit version of AROS. Maybe it's time for Hollywood's developer to decide to release their program for the main 64-bit line of AROS?
