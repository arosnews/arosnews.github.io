In December, the AROS system received many interesting changes and improvements that increase its functionality and performance. The most important news is the release of a new base version of the 32-bit system for x86 (ABIv0) by **deadwood**, which introduces nearly 1000 changes from several AROS developers, including hardware support and Wanderer desktop enhancements, updates of several libraries and many bug fixes.

The release of the new base version resulted in almost immediate appearance of updated distributions. **Tiny AROS v3.0** and **AROS One v2.3** came out.

Due to the huge amount of changes, it is not advisable to overwrite the old system with the new one. You should install the new system “clean”. Preferably on one of the [recommended hardware](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Platforms/x86_Complete_System_HCL#Recommended_hardware).

In the December survey for the “Irritating bug of the month”, the problem with changing the name under Wanderer was chosen.

Of course, the bug was fixed by **deadwood** as a priority, and a new survey has already appeared for January. We encourage you to register on the forum and take part in the next vote.

Work is also underway on the next ABIv0 build. The most important change will be the transition to the **new C library**. This step will require re-testing a large part of the software, so if you feel like it, you can help with the tests. You can find the test build [in this thread](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1171&rowstart=0).

Finally, as usual, news from AROS Archives. This month, several new items appeared, so there is something to play with :) Below is a detailed list.

> ## [XPDF-GUI](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=office/dtp/xpdf-gui.i386-aros.zip) (v. 1.1)
> (author: Yannick Buchy)

This is a new graphical user interface created with Hollywood for XPDF Suite. This interface uses XPDF commands: pdfinfo, pdfdetach, pdffonts, pdftohtml, pdfimages, pdftopng, pdftoppm, pdftops and pdftotxt. They should be copied to the Bin/ drawer. The interface facilitates converting and extracting text and images from PDF files.

Changes in version 1.1:
- fixed: the information window was not cleared in some conditions
- added the destination path
- improved the iconification icon
- now the operation selection keeps the same state. For example, after selecting the “Get Information” option, when you then select another PDF file, you will immediately get information about the new PDF file. The same applies to the “Get List of Embedded Files” and “Get List of Used Fonts” options.
- added keyboard shortcuts

The program also shows you the phase of the moon, which is useful for planting seeds, and the Celtic-Wiccan holidays or sabbats, which are related to the cycle of nature. In addition, it informs you about various events, such as Christmas, seasons and many others.

> ## [Apng](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=development/library/apng_amiga.lha) (v. 1.3)
> (author: Andreas Falkenhahn)

This plugin allows Hollywood to load and save animations in APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) format. The great advantage of APNG format is that it supports animations using alpha channel transparency. Neither IFF ANIM nor GIF ANIM formats support alpha channel transparency. In addition, APNG can also handle frame data in true color. The competing format for APNG is MNG, but APNG was chosen because it is supported by more applications.

Changes in version 1.3:
- Fix: APNG files without transparency channel were not loaded correctly (reported by Juan Carlos Herrán Martín).
