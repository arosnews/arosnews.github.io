In July, Deadwood began work on updating the OWB browser (according to [Development plan](https://arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1114&rowstart=20&pid=5871#post_5869)). On the AROS World forum, topics have been set up for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the browser. There you can download the latest development version and participate in testing, which I strongly encourage you to do. At the same time, a public version of AROS 64-bit has been released on which you can work with the 64-bit Odyssey Web Browser.

We posted a series of tutorials on the blog on how to install Odyssey Web Browser in different environments:
- [Odyssey Web Browser on AROS Linux hosted](https://arosnews.github.io/OWB-aros-linux-hosted/)  
- [Odyssey Web Browser on AxRT Linux](https://arosnews.github.io/OWB-axrt-linux/)  
- [Odyssey Web Browser on AxRT Windows 11 (WSL2)](https://arosnews.github.io/OWB-axrt-wsl2/)  

The Tiny AROS distribution has been updated to version 3.3. The most important change is Wanderer as the default desktop environment (previously the default environment was Magellan). This change was probably dictated by the fixes that have befallen Wanderer in recent months. A full list of changes to the accompanying software can be found at [project website](https://www.tinyaros.it/).

A video of a nearly 3-hour [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KigowKD1Aag) of an overview of AROS One 2.5 features and software is available for viewing on YouTube on the Amiten TV channel. **Amiten TV** uses a fully supported PC, 3D graphics card, sound card, network card. The video is in Spanish. Recommended!

An AROS version for AXRuntime has been spotted on [OSNews.com](https://www.osnews.com/story/140225/package-amigaos-software-for-linux-and-windows-with-axruntime/). It's worth checking out this post and the comments posted below it.

In the poll for Irritating Bug of the Month, we had a tie in July. An equal number of votes were received by submissions:  
*#144 (Graphical artifacts when dragging an icon)*  
*#25 (Shell won't open from icon that leave out)*

*Iritating Bug of the Month - July 2024*

Fixed by **Deadwood** is bug *#25*, and this [fix](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1279&pid=5842#post_5811) essentially also resolves bug *#26 Multiple copying of the “Shell” icon when it's deleted*. So in July we have the two Annoying bugs fixed, and bug *#144* moves to August.  

The AROS Archives is feeling the holiday season, as there are not many new programs, but even from this amount you can choose something interesting :)
