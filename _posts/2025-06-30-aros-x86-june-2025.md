New month, new news! It's time for another summary of progress - and June really brought a lot of good news. First of all, we recorded a lot of program conversions from 32-bit to 64-bit versions. This is very gratifying, because it means that our goal this year - full transition to 64-bit distributions - is becoming more and more realistic.

Deadwood continues to work hard on version 3.0 of the Odyssey browser. Already, based on the test version, there are significant improvements in support for many sites (Discord.com works!). The final release is fast approaching! If you want to stay up to date or join the tests - please visit the dedicated forum thread.

Kalamatee, on the other hand, had an exceptionally active month - his patches covered the entire AROS repository: from toolchain to cross-platform support, configurations to build scripts. Great, solid work!

Other developers aren't idle either - something is in the making, and it's possible that we'll soon be pleasantly surprised. In the meantime, let's see what's new coming to the AROS Archives in June:

> ## [Dave Gnukem](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=game/platform/davegnukem.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) (v. 1.0.2) `x86_64`
> (author:	David Joffe)

Dave Gnukem is a retro-style 2D scrolling platform shooter inspired by the 1991 classic Duke Nukem 1. Although it draws from it the atmosphere, graphics and spirit of the era of the 16-color 320×200 resolution EGA, it is neither a clone nor a remake. Instead, it offers its own take on the genre - gameplay and visuals in a “similar but different” style, with a distinct twist. It's a kind of parody of the original that pays homage to the classics while maintaining an authorial identity.

> ## [SDL PoP](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=game/platform/sdlpop.x86_64-aros-v11.zip) (v. 1.14) `x86_64`
> (author:	NagyD)

SDL-PoP is an open-source port of the classic Prince of Persia game (originally released by Broderbund in 1989), which was rewritten from the original Apple II and DOS source code, using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. This makes the port work on multiple platforms. The game retains all original mechanics, levels, graphics and sounds.

We have several demoscene productions, previously available only on the 32-bit version of the system, and now compiled for x86_64:

Software for the 32-bit system is still coming out:

> ## [Dopus5](https://archives.arosworld.org/?function=showfile&file=utility/filetool/dopus5_92_i386-aros.zip) (v. 5.92) `i386`
> (author:	Dopus5 Team)

A new version of the classic file manager from the “Magellan” line. For now for the 32-bit version of the system, but work is underway on Direcory Opus 5.92 for the latest AROS x86_64.

For i386 we also have updates for applications created with the Hollywood program. Here we are hoping that the manufacturer of Hollywood will release a version of its package for AROS 64-bit. If that doesn't happen, we will have to wait for an emulator that will enable them to run on x86_64.
