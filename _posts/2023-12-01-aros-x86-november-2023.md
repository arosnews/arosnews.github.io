**AROS**, one of the three branches of the so-called **New Generation Amiga**, is doing quite well considering the small number of developers (which is unfortunately a problem of the entire Amiga family). However, if we do not sit on typical AROS forums, we may get the wrong impression that nothing new is happening in this field. I decided to start monthly summaries of events from the AROS world, so as to present the most important changes without unnecessary waffling to those Amiga fans who are not into the topic on a daily basis.
  
The most actively developed version of AROS is the **32-bit version (ABIv0)** which is currently maintained by **Krzysztof “deadwood” Śmiechowicz** and we will focus on tracking this version, as it is recommended for installing on real hardware as of today.

{: .box-success}
The latest, clean system: [ABIv0](https://github.com/deadw00d/AROS/releases/tag/ABIv0_20211128-1)

Based on the current ABIv0, two distributions are supported on an ongoing basis, i.e. systems stuffed with packages of additional software:  
[Aros One x86](https://sites.google.com/view/arosone)  
[Tiny Aros i386](https://tinyaros.flazio.com)  
I do not recommend other distributions such as the popular **Icaros Desktop** a few years ago, at least until the authors update them.

In November, thanks to the effort of deadwood and the community, 16 bugs were fixed, which brings us closer to the release of a new stable version of ABIv0 in December.

One of the bugs was fixed as part of the **“Bug of the Month”** initiative, which means that users of the [ArosWorld](https://www.arosworld.org) forum vote in a poll for the most annoying bug in their opinion, and then it is fixed as a priority :) In November, this way the problem in the workbench.library was eliminated. The current poll can be found in [this topic](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1158).

Another new initiative is to make a **list of recommended hardware for AROS x86**. For years, there has been a misconception that since AROS x86 exists, it should run on any x86 hardware. No, that’s not the case and it won’t be for a long time. Of course, checking if AROS happens to work on what we have at hand can be great fun in itself, but if we want to use this system we should reach for one of the recommended hardware. They were selected not only in terms of current compatibility, but also price and availability on portals such as Ebay or Aliexpress. On the [list of fully supported hardware](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Platforms/x86_Complete_System_HCL#Recommended_hardware) we have two laptops, one complete desktop and two motherboards. The list is not yet closed and there will certainly be additional items on it.

At the end, I would always like to throw in a summary of new software. This month, unfortunately, we did not have the premiere of any big program. However, there were a few smaller productions and updates on [Aros Archives](http://archives.aros-exec.org). I leave you with the list below until next month :)
