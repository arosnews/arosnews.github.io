AROS One 2.5 came out in June, and the distribution prepared by Carlo "AMIGASYSTEM" Spadoni is based on the latest base system and includes all the latest updates and fixes. The author spent a lot of effort configuring and testing the included software, of which there is really a lot. We have everything necessary for the system at hand. AROS One also features modern, high-quality backgrounds, windows and icons. This makes AROS One currently the best distribution for both beginning AROS users and advanced ones.

On James Mattson's YouTube channel you can see some videos of AROS One 2.5 in action: [Video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_E9SkgzHEw), [Video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0frJFbanXc), [Video3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBkEZjfg5yM). 

As part of the **Irritating Bug of the Month** in June, Deadwood took care of the bug:  
*#140 (Wanderer: Changing the disk label does not work)*  
The relevant fix can already be downloaded in [June survey thread](https://arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1266&pid=5703#post_5671).  
The current poll can be found here: [Irritating Bug of the Month - July](https://arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1279&pid=5712).

The **Prototype** of an emulator that runs 32-bit programs on the 64-bit version of AROS has been completed. The role of the emulator is to create a temporary bridge to enable migration. Over time, the emulator should be used less and less, and more and more applications will be natively 64-bit. The emulator's source code is available to developers who may be interested in participating in the project. Details, a link to the sources and a video of how the emulator works can be found in [thread](https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=1218&rowstart=40&pid=5372) on the AROSWorld forum.

Finally, as usual, news from the AROS Archives, where several smaller productions and updates have appeared. Below is a detailed summary.

> ## [Python](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=development/language/i386-aros-python2.5.2.zip) (v. 2.5.2)

> (author: Joerg Schulenburg)

GOCR is an optical character recognition program released under a GNU General Public License. It reads images in many formats and generates a text file. Possible image formats are pnm, pbm, pgm, ppm, some pcx and tga image files.  

This is a new compilation of version 0.52 of the program, working with the latest version of AROS.

> ## [Image2PDF](http://archives.aros-exec.org/?function=showfile&file=office/dtp/image2pdf.lha) (v. 2.7)
> (author: Bernd Assenmacher)

A small tool for converting images to PDF. It is primarily used to convert scans made with, for example, Scandal or Scanquix to PDF documents in specific output formats such as A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter or ImageSize, but can also be used to convert other image files.

Changes in version 2.7:
- some minor cosmetic fixes have been made
- improved tooltips
- expanded the scaling range of the "scale image(s) to" function (now 10-6000)
- added "abort" function to have the ability to abort processes when there are multiple images in the loop. This does not work with the "Convert PDF to" function.
